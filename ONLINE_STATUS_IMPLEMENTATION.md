3. **Status Persistence**: Online status is maintained across page refreshes and browser sessions

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **Socket Service**:
   - Added tracking of online users using a Map structure
   - Added broadcasting of user status events when users connect/disconnect
   - Added a method to retrieve all online users

2. **User Controller**:
   - Added API endpoint for retrieving online users
   - Implemented retrieval of detailed user information for online users

3. **Socket Controller**:
   - Added helper function to get detailed user information for online users

### Frontend Changes
1. **ConversationContext**:
   - Added state for tracking online users
   - Added event listeners for user status updates
   - Added helper function to check if a user is online
   - Added initial loading of online users when the socket connects

2. **ChatHeader Component**:
   - Added visual indicator (green dot) for online status
   - Added text indicator showing "online" or "offline"

3. **Chat List Component**:
   - Added visual indicator (green dot) for online status in the user list
   - Added text indicator showing "(online)" for online users

## Testing
1. **Debug Page**:
   - Created a debug page at `/debug/online-status` for testing online status functionality
   - Shows all currently online users and their status

2. **Test Script**:
   - Created a comprehensive test script in `test-online-status.js`
   - Simulates multiple users connecting and disconnecting
   - Tests the API endpoint for retrieving online users

## How to Test
1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd /var/www/criptography
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend application:
   ```
   cd /var/www/cryptography-chat-app
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open multiple browser windows or tabs and log in with different user accounts

4. Observe the online status indicators in the chat header and chat list

5. Close one of the browser windows/tabs and observe the status change to offline in the other window

6. Visit the debug page at `/debug/online-status` to see all online users

## Notes
- Online status is determined by socket connection
- When a user closes their browser or loses connection, their status will change to offline after a brief delay
- The API endpoint `/api/online-users` can be used to retrieve the current list of online users
