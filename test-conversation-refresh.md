# Conversation Refresh Functionality Test

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented conversation refresh functionality that triggers when a new user is selected for messaging. Here's what was added:

### 1. Enhanced Layout (`app/layout.js`)
- Added `ConversationProvider` to wrap the entire app
- Now provides global conversation state management

### 2. Updated Chat List Component (`app/components/chat-list.jsx`)
- Fixed to properly use `useConversationContext` hook
- Added manual refresh button with loading state
- Added proper loading, error, and empty state handling
- Uses `conversations` from context instead of local state

### 3. Enhanced New User Component (`app/components/new-user.jsx`)
- Added `useConversationContext` import
- Triggers `refreshConversations()` when user is selected
- Resets selected user state for re-selection

### 4. Updated Chat Inbox Component (`app/components/chat-inbox.jsx`)
- Added `useConversationContext` import
- Triggers `refreshConversations()` when conversation is found/created
- This ensures sidebar updates when navigating to a user chat

## Flow Explanation

1. **User clicks "New message" button** → Opens user selection dialog
2. **User selects a user and clicks "Continue"** → 
   - Navigates to `/user/{id}` 
   - Triggers `refreshConversations()` immediately
3. **Chat inbox loads** → 
   - Fetches/creates conversation with selected user
   - Triggers `refreshConversations()` again when conversation is established
4. **Sidebar updates** → Shows the new or existing conversation in the list

## Key Features

### Manual Refresh Button
- Added refresh button next to "New message" button
- Shows loading spinner when refreshing
- Provides user control over conversation list updates

### Automatic Refresh Triggers
- When user is selected in new message dialog
- When conversation is loaded/created in chat inbox
- Ensures sidebar is always up-to-date

### Error Handling
- Loading states during refresh
- Error display if conversations fail to load
- Empty state when no conversations exist

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Manual Refresh:**
   - Click the refresh button (circular arrow icon) next to "New message"
   - Verify it shows loading spinner and updates the conversation list

2. **Test New User Selection:**
   - Click "New message" button
   - Search for and select a user
   - Click "Continue"
   - Verify sidebar updates with new/existing conversation

3. **Test Navigation:**
   - Navigate directly to `/user/{id}` 
   - Verify conversation appears in sidebar after loading
